Save all chat logs for the current project in a chat_logs.md file.

Ensure that adequate backups of the chat_logs.md file are kept in order to preserve all chats.

Use the following guidelines for chat logs:

    Include the LLM name in the header
    Add metadata about the conversation
    Preserve the full transcript with formatting
    Maintain a clear, readable structure

Sample format for chat logs:

```
    # Conversation Log: GPT-4o

    ## Conversation Details
